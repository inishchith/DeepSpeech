# DeepSpeech2
Python3 installation and complete setup only for prediction of Baidu's deep speech 2 model.

Implementation of DeepSpeech2 architecture for ASR. It is an open-source
implementation of end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engine, based on
Baidu&#39;s Deep Speech 2 paper, with PaddlePaddle platform. Biaduâ€™s pre-trained model for
English is used for inference.
